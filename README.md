# Java-Interview-Practice

There are a lot of computer science graduates and programmers applying for programming, coding, and software development roles, I remember as a fresher I always struggled to clear the technical round because I used to get nervous about the questions an interviewer can ask due to lack of practice.
So here is the list of **top 25 java programs** that can help you practice and most of them are generally asked in an Interview. 

They are simple, but yet they give a good indication of the coding skill of prospective candidates. They are usually preferred by many companies because it often requires 10 to 20 minutes to write the solution and discuss them.

In the repo above you will find the following programes:-

01. Fibonacci series
02. A prime number
03. String Palindrome
04. Integer Palindrome
05. Armstrong number
06. Avoiding deadlock in Java
07. Factorial 
08. Reverse a String
09. Find the missing integer
10. The first non-repeated character of String
11. Patterns of various kinds 
12. Find the minimum and maximum element in an array
13. Find the occurrence of an integer in the array
14. Find the occurrence of an character in the array
15. Move all the negative elements to one side of the array
16. Jaro Distance
17. String Anagram
18. Remove duplicates from an array
19. The square root of a number
20. Leap year
21. Find the factorial of a large number
22. Count Pairs with given sum
23. Finding the length of Array
24. Finding the Sum of first 100 integers(1-100)
25. Find all pairs of an integer array whose sum is equal to a given number.
